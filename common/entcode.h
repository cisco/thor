/*Set this flag 1 to enable a "reduced overhead" version of the entropy coder.
  This uses a partition function that more accurately follows the input
   probability estimates at the expense of some additional CPU cost (though
   still an order of magnitude less than a full division).

  In classic arithmetic coding, the partition function maps a value x in the
   range [0, ft] to a value in y in [0, r] with 0 < ft <= r via
    y = x*r/ft.
  Any deviation from this value increases coding inefficiency.

  To avoid divisions, we require ft <= r < 2*ft (enforcing it by shifting up
   ft if necessary), and replace that function with
    y = x + OD_MINI(x, r - ft).
  This counts values of x smaller than r - ft double compared to values larger
   than r - ft, which over-estimates the probability of symbols at the start of
   the alphabet, and under-estimates the probability of symbols at the end of
   the alphabet.
  The overall coding inefficiency assuming accurate probability models and
   independent symbols is in the 1% range, which is similar to that of CABAC.

  To reduce overhead even further, we split this into two cases:
  1) r - ft > ft - (r - ft).
     That is, we have more values of x that are double-counted than
      single-counted.
     In this case, we still double-count the first 2*r - 3*ft values of x, but
      after that we alternate between single-counting and double-counting for
      the rest.
  2) r - ft < ft - (r - ft).
     That is, we have more values of x that are single-counted than
      double-counted.
     In this case, we alternate between single-counting and double-counting for
      the first 2*(r - ft) values of x, and single-count the rest.
  For two equiprobable symbols in different places in the alphabet, this
   reduces the maximum ratio of over-estimation to under-estimation from 2:1
   for the previous partition function to either 4:3 or 3:2 (for each of the
   two cases above, respectively), assuming symbol probabilities significantly
   greater than 1/32768.
  That reduces the worst-case per-symbol overhead from 1 bit to 0.58 bits.

  The resulting function is
    e = OD_MAXI(2*r - 3*ft, 0);
    y = x + OD_MINI(x, e) + OD_MINI(OD_MAXI(x - e, 0) >> 1, r - ft).
  Here, e is a value that is greater than 0 in case 1, and 0 in case 2.
  This function is about 3 times as expensive to evaluate as the high-overhead
   version, but still an order of magnitude cheaper than a division, since it
   is composed only of very simple operations.
  Because we want to fit in 16-bit registers and must use unsigned values to do
   so, we use saturating subtraction to enforce the maximums with 0.

  Enabling this reduces the measured overhead in ectest from 0.805% to 0.621%
   (vs. 0.022% for the division-based partition function with r much greater
   than ft).
  It improves performance on ntt-short-1 by about 0.3%.*/
